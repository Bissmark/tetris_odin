- I need to add the next piece at the top of the play area - done
- After a second it needs to start falling in the play area - done
- Then let the player be able to rotate the piece with the up arrow key - done
- also let them move the piece left and right (will do the faster speed down later on) - done
- New to confine the pieces as they are falling in the play area
- When the piece hits the bottom allow a tiny amount of time for moving before the piece gets locked
- After piece is locked the next piece will appear at the time of the play area again
- Figure out collision between blocks on the play area when they get locked
- Do the row deletion if all the row is full with blocks
- add timer to speed up game after certain amount of pieces are removed
- add score
- allow player to start at harder (faster) difficulty
